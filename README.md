# Calculator
A JavaScript-powered calculator web application for performing basic arithmetic operations with dynamic user input and output.


The JavaScript Calculator project is a web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, aimed at providing users with a dynamic tool for performing arithmetic operations. The HTML structure lays the foundation for the calculator's interface, comprising elements such as buttons for digits, mathematical operators, and a display area to show the input and output.

CSS styling is applied to enhance the visual appearance of the calculator, including font styles, colors, and layout adjustments to ensure an intuitive user experience. JavaScript plays a pivotal role in the functionality of the calculator, handling user input, processing mathematical operations, and updating the display dynamically.

Through event listeners and DOM manipulation, users can interact with the calculator by clicking on buttons to input numbers and operators, triggering JavaScript functions to perform calculations in real-time. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as functionalities like decimal input and clearing the display.

This project provides an opportunity for hands-on learning of JavaScript programming concepts such as event handling, function implementation, and mathematical operations, while also showcasing the practical application of web development skills in creating interactive and functional user interfaces.
